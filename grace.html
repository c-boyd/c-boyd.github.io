  <h1>"A Poem About Grace"</h1>
  <p>This is a little collection of poems about "grace." I did not write them. It is a hard word to define, but one that carries a lot of weight when used in writing, especially in poetry. Some of these poems make concious efforts to explain the word, some do not. They are all here because they put the word on the page. I don't know any more than that--like Louise Glück said once, "I am trying to be a witness, not a theorist."</p>

<p2> Maybe you need to write a poem about grace. </br></br>

When everything broken is broken,   </br>
and everything dead is dead,</br>
and the hero has looked into the mirror with complete contempt,</br>
and the heroine has studied her face and its defects</br>
remorselessly, and the pain they thought might,</br>
as a token of their earnestness, release them from themselves</br>
has lost its novelty and not released them,</br>
and they have begun to think, kindly and distantly,</br>
watching the others go about their days—</br>
likes and dislikes, reasons, habits, fears—</br>
that self-love is the one weedy stalk</br>
of every human blossoming, and understood,</br>
therefore, why they had been, all their lives,   </br>
in such a fury to defend it, and that no one—</br>
except some almost inconceivable saint in his pool</br>
of poverty and silence—can escape this violent, automatic</br>
life’s companion ever, maybe then, ordinary light,</br>
faint music under things, a hovering like grace appears.</br></br>

As in the story a friend told once about the time </br>  
he tried to kill himself. His girl had left him.</br>
Bees in the heart, then scorpions, maggots, and then ash.   </br>
He climbed onto the jumping girder of the bridge,   </br>
the bay side, a blue, lucid afternoon.</br>
And in the salt air he thought about the word “seafood,”</br>
that there was something faintly ridiculous about it.</br>
No one said “landfood.” He thought it was degrading to the rainbow perch</br>
he’d reeled in gleaming from the cliffs, the black rockbass,  </br> 
scales like polished carbon, in beds of kelp</br>
along the coast—and he realized that the reason for the word   </br>
was crabs, or mussels, clams. Otherwise</br>
the restaurants could just put “fish” up on their signs,  </br> 
and when he woke—he’d slept for hours, curled up   </br>
on the girder like a child—the sun was going down</br>
and he felt a little better, and afraid. He put on the jacket   </br>
he’d used for a pillow, climbed over the railing   </br>
carefully, and drove home to an empty house.</br></br>

There was a pair of her lemon yellow panties</br>
hanging on a doorknob. He studied them. Much-washed.   </br>
A faint russet in the crotch that made him sick   </br>
with rage and grief. He knew more or less</br>
where she was. A flat somewhere on Russian Hill.   </br>
They’d have just finished making love. She’d have tears   </br>
in her eyes and touch his jawbone gratefully. “God,”   </br>
she’d say, “you are so good for me.” Winking lights,   </br>
a foggy view downhill toward the harbor and the bay.   </br>
“You’re sad,” he’d say. “Yes.” “Thinking about Nick?”</br>
“Yes,” she’d say and cry. “I tried so hard,” sobbing now,</br>
“I really tried so hard.” And then he’d hold her for a while—</br>
Guatemalan weavings from his fieldwork on the wall—</br>
and then they’d fuck again, and she would cry some more,   </br>
and go to sleep.</br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he, he would play that scene</br>
once only, once and a half, and tell himself</br>
that he was going to carry it for a very long time</br>
and that there was nothing he could do</br>
but carry it. He went out onto the porch, and listened   </br>
to the forest in the summer dark, madrone bark</br>
cracking and curling as the cold came up.</br></br>

It’s not the story though, not the friend</br>
leaning toward you, saying “And then I realized—,”</br>
which is the part of stories one never quite believes.  </br> 
I had the idea that the world’s so full of pain</br>
it must sometimes make a kind of singing.</br>
And that the sequence helps, as much as order helps—</br>
First an ego, and then pain, and then the singing.</br>

<p2> <i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for Darlene Wind and James Welch </i> </br></br>


I think of Wind and her wild ways the year we had nothing to lose and lost it anyway in the cursed country of the fox. We still talk about that winter, how the cold froze imaginary buffalo on the stuffed horizon of snowbanks. The haunting voices of the starved and mutilated broke fences, crashed our thermostat dreams, and we couldn’t stand it one more time. So once again we lost a winter in stubborn memory, walked through cheap apartment walls, skated through fields of ghosts into a town that never wanted us, in the epic search for grace. </br></br>

Like Coyote, like Rabbit, we could not contain our terror and clowned our way through a season of false midnights. We had to swallow that town with laughter, so it would go down easy as honey. And one morning as the sun struggled to break ice, and our dreams had found us with coffee and pancakes in a truck stop along Highway 80, we found grace. </br></br>
   
I could say grace was a woman with time on her hands, or a white buffalo escaped from memory. But in that dingy light it was a promise of balance. We once again understood the talk of animals, and spring was lean and hungry with the hope of children and corn. </br></br>
   
I would like to say, with grace, we picked ourselves up and walked into the spring thaw. We didn’t; the next season was worse. You went home to Leech Lake to work with the tribe and I went south. And, Wind, I am still crazy. I know there is something larger than the memory of a dispossessed people. We have seen it. </br>

<h2 id="blackbirds"> Blackbirds </br> by Susan Mitchell </h2>

<p2> Because it is windy, a woman </br>
finds her clothesline bare, and without rancor</br>
unpins the light, folding it into her basket.</br>
The light is still wet. So she irons it.</br>
The iron hisses and hums. It knows</br>
how to make the best of things.</br>
The woman’s hands smell clean.</br>
When she shakes them out,</br>
they are voluminous, white.</br>
All night my hands weep in gratitude</br>
for the little things. That feet are not shoes.</br>
That blackbirds are eating the raspberries. That parsley</br>
does not taste like bread.</br>
From now on I want to live</br>
only by grace. In other words, not to deserve things.</br>
Without rancor, light dives down</br>
among the turnips. I eat it with my stew.</br>
Today the woman’s hands smell like roots. When she</br>
shakes them out, they are voluminous, green.</br>
All day they shade me from the sun.</br>
The blackbirds have come to sit in them.</br>
Since this morning, the wind has been enough.</br>
